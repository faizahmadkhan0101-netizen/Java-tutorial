# 🎓 Java Programming Tutorial for Beginners

Welcome to this beginner-friendly Java programming tutorial! This repository contains practical examples to help you understand fundamental programming concepts using Java.

## 📚 Course Contents

### 1. Basic Calculations and Variables (class1.java)
In this lesson, we learn about:
- Variables in Java
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Calculating percentages
- Working with different data types (int, double)

**Example:** We calculate a student's percentage based on their marks in Physics, Chemistry, and Biology.

### 2. Prime Number Check (class3.java)
In this lesson, we explore:
- Control flow statements (if-else)
- Loops in Java
- Mathematical operations
- Boolean variables
- Algorithm implementation

**Example:** We implement a program that checks whether a number is prime or not using an efficient algorithm.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer
- Any text editor or IDE (like VS Code, Eclipse, or IntelliJ IDEA)

### How to Run the Programs
1. Open terminal in the project directory
2. Compile the Java file:
   ```
   javac filename.java
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```
   java filename
   ```

## 📝 Learning Path

1. Start with `class1.java` to understand basic variables and calculations
2. Move on to `class3.java` to learn about control structures and more complex algorithms

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will understand:
- Basic Java syntax
- Variables and data types
- Mathematical operations
- Control flow statements
- Simple algorithm implementation

## 💡 Tips for Beginners

- Type the code yourself instead of copying and pasting
- Experiment with different values
- Try to modify the programs to solve similar problems
- Don't hesitate to make mistakes - they're part of learning!

## 📌 Important Notes

- Each class file contains comments explaining the code
- The examples progress from simple to more complex concepts
- Feel free to experiment with the code to better understand how it works
